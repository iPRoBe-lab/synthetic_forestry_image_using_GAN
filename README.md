<h1>Synthesizing Forestry Images Conditioned on Plant Phenotype Using a Generative Adversarial Network</h1>
<b>Abstract:</b> Plant phenology and phenotype prediction using remote sensing data is increasingly gaining the attention of the plant science community to improve agricultural productivity. This work aims to generate synthetic forestry images that satisfy certain phenotypic attributes, viz. canopy greenness. We harness a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize biologically plausible and phenotypically stable forestry images conditioned on the greenness of vegetation (a continuous attribute) over a specific region of interest that describes a particular vegetation type in a mixed forest. The training data is based on the automated digital camera imagery provided by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and processed by the PhenoCam Network. Our method helps render the appearance of forest sites specific to a greenness value. The synthetic images are utilized to predict another phenotypic attribute, viz., redness of plants. The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) are used to assess the quality of the synthetic images. The greenness and redness indices of the synthetic images are compared against that of the original images using Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE) to evaluate their accuracy and integrity. The generalizability and scalability of our proposed GAN model is determined by effectively transforming it to generate synthetic images for other forest sites and vegetation types.
